This was written as a proof of concept on how easy/hard it is for an app to record you on an app and convert it into text. And it plays it back. Thanks to privacy changes on Android, it's no longer possible to record this in background.

I used to teach this as a class project because it was something a newbie could do within an hour and it was a nice party trick for students. In the past, if you downloaded the app, you had full permission to record any time. 

In Android 6 (2015), they introduced it as a "dangerous permission" and you had to face the dialog box. But once you gave it permission (e.g. video/instagram or voice message/whatsapp), they could do it whenever.

In Android 10 (2019), it was forced that you couldn't run the mic in the background and that only one app could use it at a time.

The speech recognition privacy levels have also gone up in a similar way. In the past, it was subtle. Now it pops up a giant microphone button and a warning that what you are sending will be uploaded.
